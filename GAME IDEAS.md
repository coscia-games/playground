# The Farm - A mystery game

It's late in the evening and your truck has broken down on the road through a backwoods farm. 
You go to the house looking for assistance but find it abandoned.
As the sun sets, you wonder what the best course of action is:

- No cell service
- Nearest town is miles away
- Wait... did you just hear wolves in the distance?

Maybe it would be alright to stay one night...
