# Game Ideas

## The Farm

A mystery game.

It's late in the evening and your truck has broken down on the road through a backwoods farm. 
You go to the house looking for assistance but find it abandoned.
As the sun sets, you wonder what the best course of action is:

- No cell service
- Nearest town is miles away
- Wait... did you just hear wolves in the distance?

Maybe it would be alright to stay one night...

## Pixel Fighters

A fighting game with pixel characters that lose pixels when they get hurt!

## Real-world levels

A proof-of-concept game idea where you take a picture, then the game transforms the environment that you took a picture of into a simple platformer.
It draws on the classic children's make-believe genre.

## Terrarium Builder

You have these `n x n x n` cubes that you can fill with material and create terrariums for small creatures.
The game is to build the terrariums so that your creatures don't die.
